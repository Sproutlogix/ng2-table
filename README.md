# ng2-table-custom

Because ng2-table just doesn't cut it. 
**Note:** This was developed for a specific purpose and is not suited for general use.


### What's different
Custom dropdown buttons are hardcoded. (cellClicked) event now also returns the name of the button pressed. This can be used to add custom functionality from the component.

### Installation
`npm install --save ng2-table-custom`

### Documentation
Refer the official ng2-table webiste: http://valor-software.github.io/ng2-table/
